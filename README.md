# Photo booth based on Chainer implementation of "Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution"
Fast artistic style transfer by using feed forward network.

## Requirement
- [Chainer](https://github.com/pfnet/chainer)
```
$ set up Chainer impplementation of fast neural style in  directory called 'cfns' inside the root directory
https://github.com/yusuketomoto/chainer-fast-neuralstyle
```
## Reference
- [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155)

Codes written in this repository based on following nice works, thanks to the author.
- [chainer-gogh](https://github.com/mattya/chainer-gogh.git) Chainer implementation of neural-style. I heavily referenced it.
- [chainer-cifar10](https://github.com/mitmul/chainer-cifar10) Residual block implementation is referred.
